## Website Sorter
Created by Hongze Chen using create-next-app

This is a basic Next.js web app that, given a URL, scrapes that webpage for its text and displays all the words from the webpage, sorted in order.
Does not work very well with highly dynamic or unorthodox webpages.

Hosted on Netlify at https://sortmywebpage.netlify.app

(This web app did not take long to make. I just wanted to try out web scraping (with Cheerio) and Next.js's Server Side Rendering.)
